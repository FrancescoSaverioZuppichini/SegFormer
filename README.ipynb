    "# Implementing SegFormer in PyTorch\n",
    "*A fast, efficient, and lightweight model for image segmentation*\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello There!! Today we'll see how to implement SegFormer in PyTorch proposed in [SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.15203).\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is here, an interactive version of this article can be downloaded from here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper proposes a new transformer-based model to tackle image segmentation. Even if \"transformer\" is nowadays a buzzword, and the model itself only has the basic attention mechanism. This model has two main advantages, first *SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale\n",
    "features*. Then, *It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of\n",
    "positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Funny enough, we are going backward in research, these two advantages are present in convnets since the beginning and we'll see that SegFormer, in the end, is just a convnet + attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following picture shows SegFormer's performance against the different models/sizes on ADE20K dataset, they have **sota**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/results.png\" width=\"500px\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's better than the old good FCN-R50 and it's 2x faster. Since it has 24 fewer FLOPS I am wondering why it's only double as fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a classic encoder-decoder/backbone-neck. A head is attached to predict the final segmentation mask. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/architecture.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to implement it in a bottom-up approach, starting from the lowest module inside the decoder. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The image in the paper is wrong** ðŸ¤¦, I don't understand why any reviewers pointed that out, maybe I am wrong. In the official [implementation](https://github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer/blob/master/mmseg/models/backbones/mix_transformer.py) there isn't a first patch embedding. The overlapping patch merging block (the purple one) should be before the Self-Efficient Attention block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what it should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/architecture_fixed.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "With a little photoshop\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/BlockCorrect.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "See the code [here](https://github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer/blob/9454025f0e74acbbc19c65cbbdf3ff8224997fe3/mmseg/models/backbones/mix_transformer.py#L318)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The Decoder used is called `MixVisionTransformer` (`MiT`), another `ViT` with some random stuff in the middle, we will call it `SegFormerDecoder`. Let's start with the first individual component of the block itself, `OverlapPatchMerging`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OverlapPatchMerging\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/OverlapPatchMerging.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OverlapPatchMerging` block can be implemented with a convolution layer with a `stride` less than the `kernel_size`, so it overlaps different patches. It's the same thing proposed years ago when you use a `stride` greater than one to reduce the input's spatial dimension. In `SegFormer`, the conv layer is followed by a layer norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `nn.LayerNorm` in PyTorch works for tensors of shape `batch, ...., channels`, we can create a `LayerNorm2d` that first swaps the `channels` axis with the last one, then applies layer norm, and swaps it back. I'll use [`einops`](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops) to make the code more readable\n",
